# To install on a mac:

1. [Download](http://emacsformacosx.com/) and Install emacs for osx.

2. Clone the repo into ~/.emacs.d:
----

by copy and pasting the following into your terminal:

```
cd ~;
mv .emacs.d emacs.d_pre_escherize;
git clone git@github.com:escherize/dotemacs.git .emacs.d;
```

3. Start emacs.
---

* Ignore any errors
* El-get will install itself
* Once it's and installed, emacs will tell you that el-get is **ready to serve**.

4. Restart emacs
----

### el-get will now download compile and install all the recipes in init.el

### It should take a few minutes to download (mostly git clone tags), and compile. Once this is done you're ready to go!
