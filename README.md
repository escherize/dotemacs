Bryan's Emacs Config
------

# To install:

1. Clone the repo into ~/.emacs.d:
----

```
cd ~;
mv .emacs.d emacs.d_pre_bryan;
git clone git@github.com:escherize/dotemacs.git .emacs.d;
```

####Start emacs once, and it will download and install el-get. Once it's downloaded, it will tell you when el-get is ready to serve.


2. Restart emacs
----

#### Now it will download compile and install all the recipes in init.el

It may take a few minutes. Once this is done you're ready to go!
